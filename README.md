# Project 1: üçΩÔ∏è Dinner & Drinks üçπ

## Description

Our group found a common interest in cooking, and so as a result, we decided to build an application that we could use as inspiration for ideas. To make the application unique, we decided to build an application that not only recommended meal recipes but drink recipes as well. With this application, users can find a recipe for a meal and a drink all on the same web page, without having to use multiple applications or websites.

For this project, we used the following 2 server-side API's: The Meal DB and the Cocktail DB.

## User Story

```
As someone who enjoys cooking and making drinks, and looking for inspiration
I want to use an application that recommends meals and/or drinks based on search filters added
So that I can enjoy cooking new meals and trying new drink recipes
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a meal and cocktail recommendation application
WHEN I search a meal by category and/or by cuisine
THEN I am presented with a recommended meal recipe that includes an image of the meal
WHEN I search a drink by category and/or by main ingredient and/or by alocohol content
THEN I am presented with a recommended drink recipe that includes an image of the drink
WHEN I click on Pin Cocktail or Pin Meal
THEN that recipe is saved in my pinned recipes page
WHEN I click on pinned recipes on the nav bar
THEN I am presented with all of my saved recipes (if any)
WHEN I click on one of the saved recipe buttons
THEN I am presented again with the recipe's intructions, ingredients and image
```
